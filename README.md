# MinerBags

Adds bags to Minecraft. All there is to say.

Craft a bag by surrounding a shulker box with leather (the bag will have any items that were in the shulker box used to craft it). Craft a diamond bag by surrounding a shulker box OR a bag with diamonds (same as before). Diamond bags have the capacity of a double chest, whereas normal bags only have the capacity of a single chest/shulker box.
